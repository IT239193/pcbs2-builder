# PC Building Simulator 2 Calculator

This project started from a simple idea — planning builds in PC Building Simulator 2 shouldn’t take guessing or switching tabs a hundred times. The calculator helps you figure out total cost, power draw, cooling, and part compatibility before you start building in-game. It runs entirely in your browser and doesn’t use any frameworks or external services.

It’s meant to feel like a sandbox tool — fast, open, and clear about what’s happening behind the scenes.

## What it does

You pick parts, and the calculator keeps track of how everything adds up. Power, cost, cooling, and compatibility all update automatically. It’s not exact physics or AI — just solid estimates based on component data. The goal is to help you design balanced, realistic builds before committing to them in the game.

## How it’s built

Everything runs with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
No backend. No database servers. No dependencies.  

The part data comes from simple JSON files that you can edit yourself. If you want to tweak values, add new parts, or change categories, go ahead — nothing’s hidden or locked behind scripts.
